# theCliteracyProject
The Cliteracy Project was conceived of and built in Cyd Cipollaâ€™s Tinkering in Feminist Technoscience course, an interdisciplinary seminary in The Gallatin School of Individualized Study. Throughout the semester students were expected to engaged with feminist science thinkers like Donna Haraway and Carol Cohn, challenge their (mis)conceptualizations of science, knowledge, and feminist theory, and finally, to build a new thing.
